Search repeating earthquakes based on cross-correlation of seismic waveforms of event pairs at same stations.

Post-processing scripts have to be written to define repeating earthquake from the calculated cross-correlation coefficients.

[FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) needs to be installed and is used to compute the discrete Fourier transform.
